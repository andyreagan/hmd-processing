The HMD mortality data for years 2010-2022 are preliminary as the US Census Bureau has yet to revise its inter-censal (2010-2019) population estimates using the results of the 2020 Population census. We will update the HMD data series as soon as the US Census Bureau has released new population estimates. We will also have access to more detailed mortality data for 2024 by then. See the Background and Documentation file for more information.
