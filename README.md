# Human Mortality Database (HMD) Processing in Python

![Notebook Runs](https://github.com/andyreagan/hmd-processing/actions/workflows/notebook-test.yml/badge.svg)

From github, view the main notebook on 
[NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/andyreagan/hmd-processing/blob/main/usa-exploration.ipynb)
for the Altair graphics to show up
(or the HTML).

An interactive version of the final graphic is available on [Observrable](https://observablehq.com/@andyreagan/human-mortality-database).

Both pieces (observable and Python) are a companion to my [blog post](https://andyreagan.com/2024-11-19-life-expectancy-is-misleading.html).
The graphics / HTML in this repo here are the ones served / linked to directly in the post.
